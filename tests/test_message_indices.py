"""Per-token attribution invariants for ``RenderedTokens.message_indices``.

Why this file exists
--------------------
The matrix in ``test_parity`` checks token-id parity against
``apply_chat_template`` — useful, but only for token *bytes*. The
per-token attribution (``RenderedTokens.message_indices``) was never
covered, even though it directly drives the loss mask in
``build_training_sample``.

That gap surfaced through two real bugs:

- ``KimiK2Renderer.render``'s unknown-role fallback emitted the closing
  ``<|im_end|>`` with the post-normalisation index ``i`` instead of the
  caller-relative ``oi``.
- ``KimiK25Renderer.render`` used the raw post-normalisation index
  everywhere, shifting *every* index by one whenever auto-system
  injection happened.

In both cases token IDs were unchanged (so render-parity still passed),
but ``message_indices`` pointed at wrong (or out-of-range) messages.

Tests in this file:

1. ``test_message_indices_in_range`` — parametrised via the conftest
   matrix. Renders a no-system multi-role conversation and asserts the
   contract: every entry in ``message_indices`` is either ``-1``
   (structural scaffolding) or a valid caller-relative index, and every
   caller message contributes at least one token. The no-system input
   forces renderers that auto-inject default system messages
   (Kimi K2 / K2.5 / K2.6) into the injection path — the path where the
   post-normalisation index can shift away from the caller-relative one.

2. ``test_kimi_k2_unknown_role_message_indices`` — Kimi-K2-specific
   regression: triggers auto-system injection plus an unknown role,
   which is exactly the path the original bug was on. Without the fix
   this test catches a stray index that points past the caller's last
   message.
